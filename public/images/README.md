# Gallery Images

This folder is for storing local artwork images for the gallery.

## Guidelines

1. Image Format
   - Use high-quality JPG or PNG formats
   - Recommended resolution: 1200x1600 pixels minimum
   - Keep file sizes under 2MB for optimal loading

2. Naming Convention
   - Use descriptive, lowercase names
   - Replace spaces with hyphens
   - Example: `sunset-landscape-2024.jpg`

3. Organization
   - Place all artwork images directly in this folder
   - Keep original files backed up separately

## Usage

To add new artwork to the gallery:
1. Add your image file to this folder
2. Update the artwork data in `src/components/Gallery.js`
3. Reference the image using the path `/images/your-image-file.jpg`
